    "1. What are the advantages of a CNN over a fully connected DNN for image classification?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-1 Fewer parameters -> faster to train\n",
    "Reuse kernel -> detect feature anywhere\n",
    "Architecture embeds knowledge of neighboring pixels\n",
    "\n",
    "Because consecutive layers are only partially connected and because it heavily reuses its weights, a CNN has many fewer parameters than a fully connected DNN, which makes it much faster to train, reduces the risk of overfitting, and requires much less training data.\n",
    "When a CNN has learned a kernel that can detect a particular feature, it can detect that feature anywhere on the image. In contrast, when a DNN learns a feature in one location, it can detect it only in that particular location. Since images typically have very repetitive features, CNNs are able to generalize much better than DNNs for image processing tasks such as classification, using fewer training examples.\n",
    "Finally, a DNN has no prior knowledge of how pixels are organized; it does not know that nearby pixels are close. A CNN architecture embeds this prior knowledge. Lower layers typically identify features in small areas of the images, while higher layers combine the lower-level features into larger features. This works well with most natural images, giving CNNs a decisive head start compared to DNNs."
